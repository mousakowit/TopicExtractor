	s= "In a market obsessed with slim, lightweight, energy-efficient machines, gaming laptops stick out like a sore thumb. Hulking 17- and 18-inch chassis dominate the category like a physical representation of a tired cliché: bigger is better. In some ways, the old phrase rings true -- these oversized machines often pack the latest and greatest components -- but any hope of reasonable portability is lost in the mass. Despite this overwhelming (and oversized) majority, a handful of small-frame rigs still make it to market each year, and one of 2013's most petite just happens to have landed on our reviews desk. Meet the Clevo W230ST, a 13-inch, ODM (original device manufacturer) gaming notebook destined to be rebadged under different brands. As such, it goes by many names -- Sager, Origin PC and AVADirect each have their own take -- but today, we're looking at Digital Storm's version, the Veloce. Can this diminutive monster keep up with the category's biggest beasts? Let's find out. Digital Storm Veloce review	See all photos19 PHOTOS	LOOK AND FEEL Digital Storm Veloce review As an ODM reseller, Digital Storm faces an interesting challenge: it has to find a way to make its version of the Clevo W230ST stand out against what its competitors are selling. Their angle? Free T-shirts. Digital Storm includes a tee with every order, packing it neatly away into the laptop's accessory box alongside a black binder. Normally we wouldn't fawn over office supplies, but the three-ring file is actually a welcome courtesy, as it neatly organizes the laptop's various documents into a single clean volume. Groundbreaking it's not, but it is reassuring to thumb through these pages to find a signed certificate of ownership, troubleshooting tips, warranty information, a pair of driver reinstallation discs and a complete checklist of the tests run on the laptop before it was shipped out. If nothing else, the presentation ensures that even the messiest gamers will be able to keep their computer's documents in order.	The company left less of a personal touch on the hardware itself: save for a Digital Storm logo on the back of the soft, rubberized lid, Clevo's stock chassis is presented without decoration. The housing itself is fairly modest, with the corners trimmed off at shallow angles. It's a safe design, offering just enough disruption to please gamers, while still being discreet enough to pass for a work machine. At 12.99 x 8.93 inches, it'll fit it in a modestly sized backpack or messenger bag. It's not the thinnest gaming laptop in its class (that honor goes to the 14-inch Razer Blade), but it makes fair use of its 1.25-inch edges: running down the right side are three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI and VGA out sockets, an Ethernet jack and the all-important charging connector. The rest of the machine is relatively bare: the front harbors only an SD / MMC reader and a quartet of LEDs, while the left is home to a pair of audio ports and a single USB 2.0 plug. Simple.	KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD Digital Storm Veloce review Perhaps we're spoiled by the class-leading keyboards of the Razer Blade and MSI GT70, but as soon as we laid hands on the Veloce, something just felt off. Lurking under the keycaps' spacious layout and illuminating backlight lies the soul of a stiff, awkward keyboard. The keys provide strong tactile feedback with each click, but every stroke lands hard, met by heavy resistance. This is highly subjective, of course, but this sort of thing matters to those who plan to use the laptop as an all-purpose machine. As a typewriter, the Veloce just feels a bit rougher than it needs to be. On the other hand, we found the lack of key-bounce to be much less distracting during gameplay; the keyboard's rigid panel somehow felt more appropriate in the heat of battle. The overall layout seems well suited for gaming too, as it naturally puts your fingers near the Alt, Shift and Ctrl keys in WASD control settings.	Like most laptops, the keyboard uses an array of Fn combinations to toggle common functions, but one important switch seems to be missing: the Windows key disable. The key layout does its best to reduce the chances of accidental Windows-key, but we still found ourselves dropping out of the occasional game due to slippage. A disable hotkey is pretty standard in most gaming rigs these days, and we certainly missed it here. DNP  Digital Storm Veloce review We were pleased to find the Veloce's trackpad responsive, accurate and completely capable of handling Windows 8 gestures -- something we're always happy to see in the PC category. Two-finger scrolling, pinch-to-zoom and image rotation all worked like a charm. The mouser's only real fault is its size, a sad consequence of the machine's petite frame. We blame the laptop's low-hanging keyboard: if the keys were only an inch farther north, the trackpad might have had enough room to offer a comfortable navigation experience.	DISPLAY AND SOUND Digital Storm Veloce review Lifting the lid reveals one of the Veloce's best features -- a 13.3-inch, matte IPS panel (non-touch) with wide viewing angles, brilliant colors and a 350-nit LED backlight. It's like the cherry on top of a sundae: a solid gaming machine just isn't complete without a strong viewing experience. We may not have always opted for the maximum 1,920 x 1,080 resolution while working in the desktop, but we welcomed the added workspace nonetheless, especially on a smaller screen like this. Sadly, the display's luminous backlight bleeds out from under the panel's frame. The effect isn't noticeable unless the monitor's image is almost completely dark, but it's still a slight letdown on an otherwise fantastic display. Unfortunately, we can't offer the same praise to the laptop's speakers: the stereo drivers here are thoroughly disappointing. Hidden underneath the laptop's tapered edge, the stereo speakers produce muted, tinny audio with little to no bass. They'll get you through the occasional YouTube video and casual game session, of course, but it's ultimately a flat experience. Naturally, a dedicated gaming headset will outperform almost any laptop speaker setup, but the Veloce's audio offering will probably be trumped by anything with a 3.5mm headphone jack. Accessorize and carry on. PERFORMANCE AND BATTERY LIFE Digital Storm Veloce review	Don't let the Veloce's diminutive footprint fool you: this 13-inch notebook is built on the same top-notch technologies as its super-sized competition: the dynamic duo of Haswell and Kepler. Under the hood, there's a 2.7GHz, quad-core Intel Core i7-4800MQ CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 2GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 765M graphics processor. If what's inside is what counts, the Veloce has it.";
	//s = "Mark Zuckerberg Will Speak At Disrupt SF Josh Constine posted yesterday 29 Comments TechCrunch Conference - San Francisco, CA With its mobile business humming, what is Facebook focused on now? Well, Mark Zuckerberg’s got some big ideas, like helping the whole world get on the Internet. And he’s going to share them with our audience when he gets on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF in September. His talk at our conference last year boosted Facebook’s share price almost 9%, so we think this one is going to be eventful too. Zuckerberg has been running Facebook for almost 10 years now. It’s gone from tiny college startup to juggernaut social network, business darling to Wall Street black sheep and back again. Now it helps 1.15 billion people connect with friends, family, businesses, and increasingly, other applications. In the meantime, Zuckerberg has tried to retain his hacker mentality while maturing to manage an increasingly complex business. He’s led Facebook to some big successes this year. It’s grown mobile to 41% of the company’s total ad revenue, and $FB shares have clawed their way back above the $38 IPO price. Not everything has gone smoothly, though. Facebook Home has been slow to gain traction, even if features like Chat Heads have done well on their own. An exodus of veterans employees and designers has shook the company. Facebook was able to buy its way out of competition with Instagram,but new photo sharing and international messaging apps are nipping at its heels. And despite a lack of conclusive evidence, critics continue to claim Facebook makes us sad and teens are tuning out. Zuckerberg Arrington But the most fascinating thing about Facebook might be Zuckerberg’s ambitious plan to bring affordable Internet to the five billion people without it. Tuesday, he announced Internet.org, a partnership with six mobile companies to make the web accessible to everyone, and published a 10-page roadmap for getting there. Disrupt will be his first public talk since the Internet.org launch, where we’ll see if he can convince the world it’s really an altruistic endeavor, and not just a long-term user growth strategy. We’ll ask Zuckerberg about all these topics and what else he’s pondering at Disrupt SF on Wednesday, September 11th. Also taking the stage will be Twitter’s Dick Costolo, Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer, Snapchat’s Evan Spiegel, and the world’s top venture capitalists. Check out all of the influential speakers and guests joining us on the full Disrupt SF agenda. Get your tickets now while you still can. We are only a week and a half away, so don’t delay if you want to come. If you’re interested in becoming a sponsor, opportunities can be found here. Students can also come be a part of Disrupt SF. We have limited student tickets available, so be sure to go here to find out how to get yours quickly. Mark Zuckerberg Founder, Chairman and CEO, Facebook Mark is the chairman and CEO of Facebook, which he founded in 2004. He is responsible for setting the overall direction and product strategy for the company, leading the design of Facebook’s service and the development of its core technology and infrastructure. Mark studied computer science at Harvard University before moving the company to Palo Alto, California. Crunchbase FACEBOOK MARK ZUCKERBERG Company: Facebook Website: facebook.com Launch Date: February 1, 2004 IPO: NASDAQ:FB Facebook is the world’s largest social network, with over 1.15 billion monthly active users. Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in February 2004, initially as an exclusive network for Harvard students. It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a Facebook network. Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, and Eduardo Saverin to help build Facebook, and within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks.

	//s = "Motorola just showed off three new Droid smartphones last month (or, if you prefer, one new Droid and two spinoffs), but it’s apparently not done cranking out Verizon hardware just yet. Another new Motorola device clad in Verizon livery was spotted in a batch of newly leaked images from Chinese social network Weibo, and it seems to hearken back to the Droid line’s roots. Unlike the trim, all-touch smartphones that Motorola has been enamored with lately, the most eye-catching feature of the alleged Droid 5 is the same sort of slide-out QWERTY keyboard its forebears also had. According to Engadget, the D5 also has a display between 4.3 and 4.5 inches and a body that’s resistant to dust and water. I know, I know, it seems a little yawn-worthy at first glance (even for sliding keyboard suckers like me). Curiously enough, that big five-row keyboard isn’t the only difference between whatever this is and the other Droids that have just started hitting store shelves. One of the images depicts a camera interface complete with a discrete shutter button on the touchscreen, a UI flourish that doesn’t exist on either the Moto X or the Droid Ultra. That super-simple, touch-anywhere approach to snapping photos on the go is a feature Motorola brass have been talking up for a while now, so it’s quite surprising to see that the company may be mulling a reversion toward the mean. If we’re lucky, that just means Motorola is still trying to lock down some of its UI experiences… though arguably a solution the company already worked out was the better way to go. The grimmer scenario is that the Droid 5 outright lacks some of the niceties its cousins have, which is certainly one way to compartmentalize a product portfolio. At this point there are still more questions than answers, but judging by the fit and finish of the phone in those images, it shouldn’t be too long before Motorola officially springs this thing on us and all our questions are answered.";

It has additional software features, expanded hardware, and a redesigned physique from its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S II. The S III employs an intelligent personal assistant (S Voice), eye-tracking ability, increased storage, and a wireless charging option. Depending on country, the 4.8-inch (120 mm) smartphone comes with different processors and RAM capacity, and 4G LTE support.[10] The device was launched with Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, and can be updated to Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. The phone's successor, the Samsung Galaxy S IV, was announced on March 14, 2013 and was released the following month. Following an 18-month development phase, Samsung unveiled the S III on 3 May 2012.[11] The device was released in 28 European and Middle Eastern countries on 29 May 2012, before being progressively released in other major markets in June 2012. Prior to release, 9 million pre-orders were placed by more than 100 carriers globally.[12] The S III was released by approximately 300 carriers in nearly 150 countries at the end of July 2012.[4] More than 20 million units of the S III were sold within the first 100 days of release.[13] Samsung has since sold more than 50 million units.[5] Due to overwhelming demand and a manufacturing problem with the blue version of the phone,[14] there was an extensive shortage of the S III, especially in the United States. Nevertheless, the S III was well-received commercially and critically, with some technology commentators touting it as the iPhone killer. In September 2012, TechRadar ranked it as the No. 1 handset in its constantly updated list of the 20 best mobile phones,[15] while Stuff magazine likewise ranked it at No. 1 in its list of 10 best smartphones in May 2012.[16] The handset also won the European Mobile Phone of 2012–13 award from the European Imaging and Sound Association,[17] as well as T3 magazine's Phone of the Year award for 2012.[18] It played a major role in boosting Samsung's record operating profit during the second quarter of 2012.[19] As of November 2012, the Galaxy S III is part of a high-profile lawsuit between Samsung and Apple.[20] In November 2012, research firm Strategy Analytics announced that the Galaxy S III had overtaken the Apple iPhone 4S to become the world's best-selling smartphone model in Q3 2012.[21] Contents 1 History 1.1 Design phase 1.2 Release 2 Features 2.1 Software and services 2.2 Hardware and design 2.2.1 Security issues 2.2.1.1 Software 2.2.1.2 Hardware 2.2.2 Hardware reliability 2.2.3 Model variants 3 Reception 3.1 Commercial reception 3.2 Critical reception 4 Litigation 5 See also 6 Notes 7 References 8 External links History Design phase Jellybean 4.2 is now on Samsung S3. Design work on the S III started in late 2010 under the supervision of Chang Dong-hoon, Samsung's Vice President and Head of the Design Group of Samsung Electronics. From the start, the design group concentrated on a trend which Samsung dubs organic, which suggests that a prospective design should reflect natural elements such as the flow of water and wind.[22] Some of the results of this design were the curved outline of the phone and its home screen's Water Lux effect, where taps and slides produce water ripples.[22] Throughout the eighteen-month design process, Samsung implemented stringent security measures and procedures to maintain secrecy of the eventual design until its launch. Designers worked on three prototypes concurrently while regarding each of them as the final product. Doing so required a constant duplication of effort as they had to repeat the same process for all three prototypes.[23][24] The prototypes, taking photos of which was forbidden, were locked in a separate lab accessible only by core designers; the company's employees transported them instead of third-party couriers.[24][25] Because we were only permitted to see the products and others weren't, explained Principal Engineer Lee Byung-Joon, we couldn't send pictures or drawings. We had to explain the Galaxy S III with all sorts of words.[26] Despite such security measures, specifications of one of the three units were leaked by Vietnamese website Tinhte, although it was not the selected design.[27][28] Speculation in the general public and media outlets regarding the handset's specifications began gathering momentum several months before its formal unveiling in May 2012. In February 2012, prior to the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, there were rumors that the handset would incorporate a 1.5 GHz quad-core processor, a display of 1080p (1,920×1,080 pixels) resolution, a 12-megapixel rear camera and a HD Super AMOLED Plus touchscreen.[29][30] More accurate rumoured specifications included 2 GB of RAM, 64 GB of internal storage, 4G LTE, a 4.8-inch (120 mm) screen, a 8-megapixel rear camera, and a 9-millimetre (0.35 in) thick chassis.[29][30] Samsung confirmed the existence of the Galaxy S II's successor on 5 March 2012, but it was not until late April 2012 that Samsung's Senior Vice-President Robert Yi confirmed the phone's name to be Samsung Galaxy S III.[31][32] Release The Galaxy S III was launched at Samsung Mobile Unpacked 2012 (3 May 2012). After inviting reporters in mid-April, Samsung launched the Galaxy S III during the Samsung Mobile Unpacked 2012 event at Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London, on 3 May 2012, instead of unveiling their products earlier in the year during either the World Mobile Congress or Consumer Electronics Show.[11][33] One explanation for this decision is that Samsung wanted to minimize the time between its launch and availability.[34] The keynote address of the hour-long event was delivered by Loesje De Vriese, marketing director of Samsung Belgium.[35] Features Software and services Further information: Android (operating system), TouchWiz, and S Voice The Galaxy S III uses Google's Android mobile operating system, which was introduced commercially in 2008.[36] Its TouchWiz Nature UX graphical user interface (GUI)—which is influenced by the organic customer trend—is more interactive than Samsung's previous GUIs, with the notable addition of the Water Lux effect, which produces ripples upon contact.[22] To complement the TouchWiz interface, and as a response to Apple's Siri, the phone introduces S Voice, Samsung's intelligent personal assistant. S Voice can recognize eight languages including English, Korean and French.[37] Based on Vlingo, S Voice enables the user to verbally control 20 functions such as playing a song, setting the alarm, or activating driving mode; it relies on Wolfram Alpha for online searches.[38] The S III comes with Android version 4.0.4, named Ice Cream Sandwich, which became commercially available in March 2012 with the Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus.[39] Ice Cream Sandwich has a refined user interface, expanded camera capabilities, security features and connectivity.[40] In mid-June 2012, Google unveiled Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, which employs Google Now, a voice-assistant similar to S Voice, and incorporates other software changes. Samsung accommodated Jelly Bean in the S III by making last-minute hardware changes to the phone in some markets.[41] Jelly Bean updates began rolling out to S IIIs in selected European countries, and to the T-Mobile in the United States in November.[42][43] On October 17, Samsung announced, that U.S. S IIIs will be updated to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean in the coming months.[44] Samsung started pushing Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean to the international version of the S III in December 2012.[45] The LTE Version of the S3 comes with the Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean preloaded. The S III is also compatible with CyanogenMod 10, a custom firmware that implements the characteristics of Jelly Bean.[46] The S III comes with a multitude of pre-installed applications, including standard Android ones like YouTube, Google+, Voice Search, Google Play, Gmail, Map, and Calendar, in addition to Samsung-specific apps such as ChatON, Game Hub, Video Hub, Social Hub and Navigation.[47][48] To address the fact that iPhone users are reluctant to switch to Android because the OS is not compatible with iTunes, from June 2012 Samsung offered customers of its Galaxy series the Easy Phone Sync app to enable the transfer of music, photos, videos, podcasts, and text messages from an iPhone to a Galaxy device.[49] The user is able to access Google Play, a digital-distribution multimedia-content service exclusive to Android, to download applications, movies, music, TV programs, games, books, and magazines.[50] ChatON has basic features which are auto friends registration, text chat, & multimedia deliver, and put new features which are My Page, voice/video chat, & translate. The main function of ChatON is divided into Multimedia, Group Chat, Trunk, and Animation Message. ChatON can send text, picture, video, & audio as multimedia. Users use the personal profile into My Page. They can create group chat rooms just by selecting more than 2 buddies. All the contents that have been shared in each chat is saved into each trunk. Animation Message turns some simple drawing and stamping into short moving videos. Apart from S Voice, Samsung has directed the bulk of the S III's marketing campaign towards the device's smart features, which facilitate improved human-device interactivity. These features include: Direct Call, or the handset's ability to recognise when a user wants to talk to somebody instead of messaging them, if they bring the phone to their head; Social Tag, a function that identifies and tags people in a photo and shares photos with them; and Pop Up Play, which allows a video and other applications to occupy the screen at the same time.[51] In addition, the S III can beam its screen to a TV or be used as a remote controller (AllShare Cast and Play) and share photos with people who are tagged in them (Buddy Photo Share).[51] Other software features include Smart Alerts, Smart Stay, and S Beam.[51] The S III can access and play traditional media formats such as music, movies, TV programs, audiobooks, and podcasts, and can sort its media library alphabetically by song title, artist, album, playlist, folder, and genre. One notable feature of the S III's music player is Music Square, which analyses a song's intensity and ranks the song by mood so that the user can play songs according to their current emotional state.[52] With the release of the S III, Samsung debuted its proprietary music management and download application called Music Hub, designed to compete with Apple's iTunes, iCloud, and iTunes Match services. Music Hub's music catalogue contains over 19 million songs.[53] The S III was the first smartphone to support Voice Over LTE with the introduction of HD Voice service in South Korea.[54] The phone enables video calling with its 1.9 MP front-facing camera, and with support for the aptX codec, improves Bluetooth-headset connectivity.[55] Texting on the S III does not embody any new significant features from the S II. Speech-to-text is aided by the Vlingo and Google's voice-recognition assistant. Not unlike other Android devices, there are a multitude of third-party typing applications available that could complement the S III's stock keyboard.[56] On 18 June 2012, Samsung announced that the S III would have a version with enterprise software under the company's Samsung Approved For Enterprise (SAFE) program, an initiative that facilitates the use of private Android devices by professional employees, also known as Bring Your Own Device.[57] The enterprise S III version would support AES-256 bit encryption, VPN and Mobile Device Management functionality, and Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync.[58] It was scheduled to be released in the U.S. in July 2012. The enterprise version was expected to penetrate the business market dominated by Research in Motion's BlackBerry, following the release of similar enterprise versions of the Galaxy Note, Galaxy S II and the Galaxy Tab line of tablet computers.[58][59] A separate Developer Edition of the S III was made available from Samsung's Developer Portal. It came with an unlockable bootloader to allow the user to modify the phone's software.[60] Hardware and design Photo of two phones turned off held next to each other with warm yellow ambience lightning. The phones are rested on a person's hand. The Galaxy Nexus (left) and the Galaxy S III The Galaxy S III has a polycarbonate plastic chassis measuring 136.6 mm (5.38 in) long, 70.7 mm (2.78 in) wide, and 8.6 mm (0.34 in) thick, with the device weighing 133 grams (4.7 oz). Samsung abandoned the rectangular design of the Galaxy S and Galaxy S II, and instead incorporated round corners and curved edges, reminiscent of the Galaxy Nexus.[61] The phone is available in two basic color options: Marble White and Pebble Blue; however, Pebble Blue has reportedly been altered to a metallic blue-grey shade.[62] A Garnet Red model was made available exclusively to U.S. carrier AT&T on 15 July 2012.[63] Sapphire Black, Titanium Gray and Amber Brown will also be available.[64] The S III comes in two distinct variations that differ primarily in the internal hardware. The international S III version has Samsung's Exynos 4 Quad system on a chip (SoC) containing a 1.4 GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 central processing unit (CPU) and an ARM Mali-400 MP graphics processing unit (GPU).[65] According to Samsung, the Exynos 4 Quad doubles the performance of the Exynos 4 Dual used on the S II, while using 20 percent less power.[66] Samsung had also released several 4G LTE versions—4G facilitates higher-speed mobile connection compared to 3G—in selected countries to exploit the corresponding communications infrastructures that exist in those markets.[67] Most of these versions use Qualcomm's Snapdragon S4 SoC featuring a dual-core 1.5 GHz Krait CPU and an Adreno 225 GPU.[68] The South Korean and Australia versions are a hybrid of the international and 4G-capable versions.[7] The S III has a maximum of 2 GB of RAM, depending on model.[67] The phone comes with either 16 or 32 GB of internal storage, with a 64 GB version to be available internationally; additionally, microSDXC storage offers a further 64 GB for a potential total of 128 GB.[69] Moreover, 50 GB of space is offered for two years on Dropbox—a cloud storage service—for purchasers of the device, doubling rival HTC's 25 GB storage for the same duration.[52] The S III's HD Super AMOLED display measures 4.8 inches (120 mm) on the diagonal, making it Samsung's third largest phone display, only exceeded by the Galaxy Note's 5.3 inches (130 mm) and the Galaxy Note II's 5.55 inches (141 mm).[70] With a 1,280×720-pixel (720p) resolution, its pixel per inch (PPI, a measure of pixel density) is a relatively high 306,[69] which is accommodated by the removal one of the three subpixels—red, green and blue—in each pixel to create a PenTile matrix-display; consequently, it does not share the Plus suffix found on the S II's Super AMOLED Plus display.[71] The glass used for the display is the damage-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 2.[61] Rear view of a blue and black phone. A camera lens is located centrally at the top. Back view of the Japanese S III model, SC-06D The S III has an 8-megapixel camera similar to that of the Galaxy S II. It can take 3,264×2,448 resolution photos and record videos in 1,920×1,080-pixel (1080p) resolution. Samsung improved the camera's software over that of its predecessor to include zero shutter lag, and Burst Mode and Best Shot, which work together to quickly take numerous photos before the best-judged frame is selected.[72] The phone can also take pictures while recording videos.[71] The rear-facing camera is complemented by a 1.9-megapixel front-facing camera that can record 720p videos.[72] The phone has LED flash and autofocus.[73][74] In addition to the 4.8-inch (120 mm) touchscreen, the S III has several physical user inputs, including a home button located below the screen, a volume key on the left side and a power/lock key on the right.[48] At the top there is a 3.5-millimetre (0.14 in) TRRS headphone jack and one of the two microphones on the S III; the other is located below the home button.[48] The S III is advertised as having an MHL port that can be used both as a micro-USB On-The-Go port, and for connecting the phone to HDMI devices. However, a retailer later discovered that Samsung had made a modification to the electronics of the port such that only the adapter made specifically for this model by Samsung could be used.[75] The S III's li-ion 2,100 mAh battery is said to have a 790-hour standby time or 11 hours of talk time on 3G, compared to 900 hours in standby and 21 hours of talk time on 2G.[47] Built into the battery is near field communication connectivity, which allows users to share map directions and YouTube videos quickly using Wi-Fi Direct (through Android Beam), and perform non-touch payments at shops that employ specially equipped NFC cash registers.[76] To help minimize battery consumption, Samsung has introduced Smart Stay, an ability to track a user's eyes and turn off whenever the person is not looking at it.[38] The battery can be wirelessly charged using a special charging pad (sold separately) that utilizes magnetic resonance to produce a magnetic field through which electricity could be transferred.[77] CNET TV torture-tested an S III by cooling it to 24 °F (−4 °C), placing it in a heat-proof box and heating it to 190 °F (88 °C), and submerging it in water—the S III survived all three tests. The phone also did not exhibit any scratches when a key was repeatedly scraped against the display.[78] However, Android Authority later carried out a drop test with the purpose of comparing the Samsung Galaxy S III and the iPhone 5. The screen on the S III shattered on the second drop test, while the iPhone received only minor scuffs and scratches on the metal composite frame after three drop tests.[79] Security issues Software On September 19, 2012, security researchers demonstrated during Pwn2Own, a computer hacking contest held in Amsterdam, Netherlands, that the S III can be hacked via NFC, allowing attackers to download all data from the phone.[80] Hardware In December 2012, two hardware issues were reported by users of the Samsung Galaxy S III: A vulnerability of the Exynos SoC allowed malicious apps to gain root privileges even on unrooted devices, and a spontaneous bricking of the unit approximately six months after activation. Samsung has been replacing the mainboards of affected units under warranty.[81][82] In January 2013, Samsung released a firmware update that corrected both issues.[83] Hardware reliability As of mid-2013 it is reported that there have been three incidents of allegedly exploding Samsung products since the product release. In 2012, a man in Dublin, Ireland said that his Galaxy S III exploded in his car, and in February 2013 a South Korean man alleged that his Galaxy Note's battery, which was not attached to the phone at the time, caught fire.[84] Model variants On 16 May 2012, NTT DoCoMo announced that they would sell an LTE model of the S III, using a Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM8960 SoC with an integrated on-die LTE-modem.[85] As of February 2013, NTT DoCoMo is selling an NTT-branded S IIIα (SC-03E) variant.[86] On 30 May 2012, several Canadian carriers announced that they also would sell an LTE model of the S III with the model number SGH-i747 and the same specifications as the one for NTT DoCoMo.[87] Within a week, on 4 June 2012, T-Mobile US and AT&T[88] announced that they would sell the same versions of the S III as the Canadian carriers announced on 30 May. Verizon, Sprint, Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile USA and U.S. Cellular sell a similar version with CDMA support. Thus the design and name of the Galaxy S III for North America is retained from the international version, marking a deviation from the previous customization of design and name for different carriers of the previous Galaxy S models.[89] The South Korean LTE models share the 4G LTE support and 2 GB of RAM of the North American and Japanese versions, but come with the international version's Samsung Exynos 4 Quad SoC, in addition to the T-DMB module and antenna; this compelled Samsung to increase the model's thickness to 9 millimetres (0.35 in).[7] A similar quad-core 4G LTE version of the S III was be released in Australia.[90] In September 2012 Samsung confirmed the launch of the 4G version of Galaxy S III (along with 4G versions of Galaxy Note II and Galaxy Note 10.1) in the Nordic countries in the fourth quarter of 2012.[91] The GT-I9300 and GT-I9305 models are certified Miracast sources.[92] The Samsung Galaxy S III Mini is a smaller phone that shares the design and software of the S III, but has different internal hardware.

Within a month of the London unveiling, auction and shopping website eBay noted a 119-percent increase in second-hand Android phone sales. According to an eBay spokesperson, this was the first time anything other than an Apple product has sparked such a selling frenzy.[120] The S III was released in 28 countries in Europe and the Middle East on 29 May 2012.[121] To showcase its flagship device, Samsung afterwards embarked on a global month-long tour of the S III to nine cities, including Sydney, New Delhi, and cities in China, Japan, South Korea and the United States.[122] The S III has helped Samsung consolidate its market share in several countries including India, where Samsung expected to capture 60 percent of the country's smartphone market, improving on its previous 46 percent.[123] Within a month of release, Samsung had a 60-percent market share in France, while the company controlled over 50 percent of the German and Italian smartphone markets.[124] Over a similar period the S III helped increase Samsung's market share in the United Kingdom to over 40 percent, while eroding the iPhone 4S's 25 percent to 20 percent in the country.[125] The S III was scheduled to be released in North America on 20 June 2012, but due to high demand, some U.S. and Canadian carriers delayed the release by several days, while some other carriers limited the market at launch.[126] The S III's U.S. launch event took place in New York City, hosted by Twilight actress Ashley Greene and attended by dubstep artist Skrillex, who performed at Skylight Studios.[127] Samsung estimated that by the end of July 2012, the S III would have been released by 296 carriers in 145 countries,[4] and that more than 10 million handsets would have been sold.[128] Shin Jong-kyun, president of Samsung's mobile communications sector, announced on 22 July that sales had exceeded 10 million.[129] According to an assessment by Swiss financial services company UBS, Samsung had shipped 5–6 million units of the phone in the second quarter of 2012 and will ship 10–12 million handsets per quarter throughout the rest of the year. An even more aggressive prediction by Paris-based banking group BNP Paribas says 15 million units will be shipped in the third quarter of 2012,[130] while Japanese financial consultant company Nomura places the figure for this quarter as high as 18 million.[131] Sales of the S III may top 40 million by the end of the year.[132] To meet demand, Samsung has hired 75,000 workers, and its South Korean factory is running at its peak capacity of 5 million smartphone units per month.[118][133] A manufacturing flaw resulted in a large portion of the new smartphones having irregularities with the hyper-glazing process. The mistake caused an undesirable finish on the blue back covers and resulted in the disposal of up to 600,000 plastic casings and a shortage of the blue model.[14] The issue was later resolved; however, Reuters estimated that the shortage had cost Samsung two million S III sales during its first month of release.[134] On 6 September 2012, Samsung revealed that sales of the S III had reached 20 million in 100 days, making it three and six times faster-selling than the Galaxy S II and the Galaxy S, respectively. Europe accounted for more than 25 percent of this figure with 6 million units, followed by Asia (4.5 million) and the U.S. (4 million); sales in South Korea, the S III's home market, numbered 2.5 million.[13] Around the same time of Samsung's announcement, sales of the S III surpassed that of the iPhone 4S in the U.S.[135] In the third quarter of 2012, more than 18 million S III units were shipped, making it the most popular smartphone at the time, ahead of the iPhone 4S's 16.2 million units. Analysts deduced that the slump in iPhone sales was due to customers' anticipation of the iPhone 5.[136] Critical reception White man wearing a suit standing with his hands held far apart, looking left of image. Technology commentator David Pogue declared the phone the crème de la Android, lauding its display size, design, and customizability, although he noted the lack of integration with an entertainment ecosystem.[137] The reception of the Galaxy S III has been particularly positive. Critics noted the phone's blend of features, such as its S Voice application, display, processing speed, and dimensions as having an edge over its competition, the Apple iPhone 4S and HTC One X.[61][71] Vlad Savov of The Verge declared it a technological triumph,[138] while Natasha Lomas of CNET UK lauded the phone's impossibly slim and light casing and a quad-core engine, calling it the Ferrari of Android phones,[71] a sentiment affirmed (a prince among Android phones) by Dave Oliver of Wired UK and (king of Android) Esat Dedezade of Stuff magazine.[139][140] Gareth Beavis of TechRadar noted that the S III is all about faster, smarter and being more minimal than ever before while keeping the spec list at the bleeding edge of technology.[141] Matt Warman of The Daily Telegraph said, On spending just a short time with the S3, I'm confident in saying that it's a worthy successor to the globally popular S2.[142] Upon release, a number of critics and publications have made references to the S III, Samsung's 2012 flagship phone,[143] as an iPhone killer,[144] responding perhaps to Apple's favourable customer perception.[145] The label owes itself to the S III's use of the Android OS—the chief rival of Apple's iOS—as well as its design and features that rival the iPhone 4S such as Smart Stay, a large display, a quad-core processor, Android customizability, and a multitude of connectivity options.[146] The S III was the first Android phone to have a higher launch price than the iPhone 4S when the Apple product was released in 2011.[147] With the S III, Tim Weber, business editor of the BBC, observed, With the new Galaxy S3 they [Samsung] have clearly managed to move to the front of the smartphone field, ahead of mighty Apple itself.[121] Conversely, reviewers have opined on the design and feel of phone, calling its polycarbonate shell cheap[148] and having a slippery feel.[141] The S Voice was described as not optimised and more rigid than Siri with its poor voice-recognition accuracy, with instances when it would not respond at all.[141][149] Another usage problem was a microphone malfunction that resulted in difficulty communicating during a call.[150] Reviewers have noted the somewhat abrupt auto-adjustment of display brightness, which tends to under-illuminate the screen;[N 2] however, it has twice the battery life compared to the HTC handset, achieved partly through the dim display.[152][N 3] Others say the numerous pre-installed apps make the S III feel bloated.[153][N 4] In late-September 2012 TechRadar ranked it as the No. 1 handset in its constantly updated list of the 20 best mobile phones;[15] Stuff magazine also ranked it at No. 1 in its list of 10 best smartphones in May 2012.[16] The Galaxy S III won an award from the European Imaging and Sound Association under the category of European Mobile Phone of 2012–2013.[17] In 2012, the Samsung Galaxy S III won T3's Phone of the Year award, beating the iPhone 4S, the Nokia Lumia 900, the Sony Xperia S and others[18] and was voted Phone of the Year by readers of tech website S21.[154] In February 2013, the Galaxy S III won the Best Smartphone award from the GSMA at Mobile World Congress.[155][156] Litigation On 5 June 2012, Apple filed for preliminary injunctions in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Samsung Electronics, claiming the Galaxy S III had violated at least two of the company's patents. Apple requested that the court include the phone in its existing legal battle against Samsung (see Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.), and ban sales of the S III prior to its scheduled 21 June 2012 U.S. launch.[157] Apple claimed the alleged infringements would cause immediate and irreparable harm to its commercial interest.[158] Samsung responded by declaring it would vigorously oppose the request and demonstrate to the court that the Galaxy S3 [sic] is innovative and distinctive, and reassured the public that the 21 June release would proceed as planned.[158] On 11 June, Judge Lucy Koh said that Apple's claim would overload her work schedule, as she would also be overseeing the trial of Samsung's other devices; consequently, Apple dropped its request to block the 21 June release of the S III.[159] In mid-July 2012, Samsung removed the universal search feature on Sprint and AT&T Galaxy S III phones with over-the-air (OTA) software updates to disable the local search function as a precautionary measure prior to its patent court trial with Apple, which began on 30 July 2012.[160] Although Apple won the trial, the S III experienced a sales spike due to the public's belief that the phone would be banned.[161] On 31 August 2012, Apple asked the same federal court to add the Galaxy S III into its existing complaint, believing the device has violated its patents; Samsung countered with the statement: Apple continues to resort to litigation over market competition in an effort to limit consumer choice.[162] On 11 October 2012 Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S III Mini, a 4-inch (100 mm) smartphone with lower specifications compared to the S III.[163] See also Samsung Galaxy S series Comparison of smartphones Comparison of Android devices Notes ^ The Sprint version of the phone contains support for CDMA over ESMR 800, a band previously used by Sprint for its Nextel iDEN network. ^ Samsung has since released an over-the-air update that includes a brightness slider.[151] ^ The test was performed with the quad-core versions of the two phones performing continuous video playback until battery is depleted.[152] ^ Others were more positive about the multitude of applications.[153] References ^ Samsung Galaxy S III.

	//s = " High quality, just the right amount of protection and a little Nexus flair Google historically hasn't had the best track record with making a lineup of accessories available for their Nexus devices. Between the almost nonexistent Galaxy Nexus accessories and the horribly late Nexus 7 dock, there haven't been too many highlights. With the Nexus 4 Google stepped in the right direction offering a bumper, headphones, charging cables and a Qi wireless charger. We now have our hands on the first official accessory in the era of the new Nexus 7, the aptly-named 'Nexus 7 Sleeve', available directly from Google Play for $30. Original snafus about the absurd shipping prices aside, this still isn't a cheap case. After all, the Nexus 7 itself starts at just $229 so why spend so much on protection for it? Well, we find that you get what you pay for. The sleeve is a relatively unassuming case, made primarily out of a flexible but durable black neoprene material, with a light rubber stenciling on one side. The cross hatch pattern is broken up in the bottom right corner by an embossed 'Nexus' logo, which matches logos also present on the zipper handle and on a tag inside. 'The entire case is extremely well made, with not a stitch out of place.' Flipping around onto the 'back' side, you have a stitched pocket that can be used for accessories such as a charging cable and headphones, but we also found it fits a Nexus 4 quite snugly as well. The zipper opens from the top left corner of the case around to about half way down the opposite side, giving plenty of room to get your Nexus 7 (the case fits both the 2012 and 2013 models) in and out without turning the case into a floppy mess in the process. On the inside you have an extremely soft grey microfiber material lining, which should keep your Nexus 7 safe no matter how long it gets left in there and bumped around. The zipper edges are pretty well protected from the tablet as well, which should save you from errant scratches. Combined with the appropriately snug fit around the edges of the tablet, this case provides a good amount of protection without being too big. The entire case is extremely well made, with not a stitch out of place. We have to say that although this case is expensive, you're getting a quality piece of gear here that will protect your tablet without question. Throw in the extra accessory pouch and some subtle but cool 'Nexus' branding and you have a case that can definitely be an option for the enthusiast that wants to protect their Nexus 7 and look good doing it. Let's hope this kicks off a whole lineup of high-quality Nexus 7 accessories available from Google Play.";
